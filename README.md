# Software sites with the black lives matter banner

Those sites putting an ugly "black lives matter" banner are ugly.
Also, there are so many ugly banners can put on those sites.
For example, how many sites have a "Free Julian Assange" banner?
So they are not only ugly, but inconsistently ugly.

- [nodejs.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20200616070113/https://nodejs.org/en/) Previously nodejs.org [dedicated the whole front page to black lives matter](https://web.archive.org/web/20200615065028/https://nodejs.org/en/), with only three Node.js related links (docs, download, security releases) left at the page footer. Personally I like this page, there is something in it. Also, as a side effect, it reveals an important fact that the most essential information of a software site is documentation, download/installation, and security advisories. Unfortunately, now node.js joined those sites with an ugly banner.

- [reactjs.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20200618030325/https://reactjs.org/) and its two clones ([preactjs.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20200607175854/https://preactjs.com/) and [infernojs.org](http://archive.vn/scY9B)).
- [typescriptlang.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20200615092305/https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [golang.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20200617001054/https://golang.org/) What interests me is they painted [their blue gopher](https://blog.golang.org/gopher) in white on the frontpage. Isn't this racism?
